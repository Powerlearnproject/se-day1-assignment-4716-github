QUESTION 2
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Here are three significant milestones in the evolution of software engineering:

i) Introduction of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s):
Description: Prior to high-level programming languages, coding was done directly in machine or assembly language, which was cumbersome and complex. The creation of high-level languages such as Fortran (1957), COBOL (1959), and Lisp (1958) transformed the field by abstracting away hardware details and allowing for more readable and maintainable code. This advancement greatly increased productivity and made it possible to develop more sophisticated software systems.

ii) Emergence of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):
Description: Structured programming arose as a solution to the growing complexity of software and the need for better code organization. Pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra and C.A.R. Hoare advocated for using clear control structures (such as loops and conditionals) and modular design. This approach aimed to enhance code clarity and reduce errors by avoiding unstructured programming practices like the use of "goto" statements, leading to more reliable and easier-to-maintain code. 

iii) Adoption of Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s):
Description: Agile methodologies, formalized with the Agile Manifesto in 2001, marked a major shift in software development. Unlike traditional, linear approaches like the Waterfall model, Agile focuses on iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. It promotes regular feedback, adaptive planning, and incremental delivery, allowing teams to adjust quickly to changes and deliver value more rapidly. This approach has become a standard practice in modern software development.

QUESTION 3

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes:

a) Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
Identifying and documenting stakeholder needs and software requirements. 

b) System Design:
Creating the softwareâ€™s architecture and design based on the requirements.

c) Implementation (or Coding):
Writing and integrating the software code based on the design.

d) Testing:
Evaluating the software to ensure it meets requirements and is free of defects.

e) Deployment:
Releasing the software to users and providing necessary installation and training

f) Maintenance:
Updating and fixing the software as needed after deployment.

QUESTION 4

Flexibility: Focuses on adaptability and less documentation.

Customer Feedback: Engages customers frequently for continuous input.

Best For:
Evolving Requirements: Projects where requirements are likely to change.

Dynamic Environments: Ideal for startups or tech projects needing rapid adaptation.

Comparison:

Approach: Waterfall is linear and structured; Agile is iterative and flexible.

Adaptability: Agile adjusts easily to changes, while Waterfall is less adaptable.
